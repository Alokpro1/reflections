When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     theyhelps keeping reporsitory safe , helps in pull or push for or from git easily.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     It helps me to keep track of my coding, what i am actually doing.
